# 🔗 LangChain Essentials Python - Local Model

## Introduction

This repository is the companion to the course located [HERE](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/langchain-essentials-python).

The notebooks in the **python_local** directory are using the Ollama gpt-oss model.  Ollama models are usually locally installed on your computer.  Please refer to the following sections to prepare your system to run the notebooks provided.

Ollama makes use of your PC's GPU(s) to support local models.  Ollama supports selected GPUs from Nvidia and AMD,  but support can vary somewhat based on the OS.  Apple silicon based devices with integrated GPUs are supported - ie the M series base as well as the Max and Ultra versions.

Follow this [LINK](https://docs.ollama.com/gpu) to see the GPUs that Ollama supports.

**Note**: If you choose a different model from what is used in the notebook you may get unexpected results.

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- The [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser is recommended
- [git](https://git-scm.com/install/) is recommended
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (includes `uvx`, required by notebook 5)
- The course requires Python >=3.11, <3.14. `uv` will take care of this for you.

- You can install ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com). After
  installing, make sure to pull a model (e.g., `gpt-oss`) to run locally:
```bash
# Pull the gpt-oss model (only need to do this once)
ollama pull gpt-oss

# Start the model locally
ollama run gpt-oss

# Check that it's running
ollama ps
```

### Installation

Download the course repository

```bash
# Clone the repo, cd to 'python_local' directory
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-langchainV1-essentials.git
cd ./lca-langchainV1-essentials/python_local
```

Make a copy of example.env

```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

**Note**: The GOOGLE_API_KEY is not required if only Ollama models are used.

Insert API keys directly into .env file, [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and [LangSmith](#getting-started-with-langsmith) (optional)

```bash
# Add Google API key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
# The course is configured for local Ollama and Google GenAI models, but you can choose others if you prefer. 
# Be sure to add the key and modify the code to call your preferred model
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here_if_you_prefer

# Optional API key for LangSmith tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=langchain-py-essentials
# If you are on the EU instance:
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com
```

Make a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

Run notebooks

```bash
# Run Jupyter notebooks directly with uv
uv run jupyter lab

# Or activate the virtual environment if preferred
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
jupyter lab
```

Optional: Setup [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/studio)

```bash
# copy the .env file you created above to the studio directory
cp .env ./studio/.
cd studio
#to run with uv
uv run langgraph dev
#to run with virtual env
langgraph dev
```

# 📚 Lessons
This repository contains nine short notebooks that serve as brief introductions to many of the most-used features in LangChain, starting with the new **Create Agent**.

---

### `L1_fast_agent.ipynb` - 🤖 Create Agent 🤖
- In this notebook, you will use LangChain’s `create_agent` to build an SQL agent in just a few lines of code.  
- It demonstrates how quick and easy it is to build a powerful agent. You can easily take this agent and apply it to your own project. 
- You will also use **LangSmith Studio**, a handy visual debugger to run, host, and explore agents.

---

### `L2-7.ipynb` - 🧱 Building Blocks 🧱
In Lessons 2–7, you will learn how to use some of the fundamental building blocks in LangChain. These lessons explain and complement `create_agent`, and you’ll find them useful when creating your own agents. Each lesson is concise and focused.

- **L2_messages.ipynb**: Learn how messages convey information between agent components.  
- **L3_streaming.ipynb**: Learn how to reduce user-perceived latency using streaming.  
- **L4_tools.ipynb**: Learn basic tool use to enhance your model with custom or prebuilt tools.  
- **L5_tools_with_mcp.ipynb**: Learn to use the LangChain MCP adapter to access the world of MCP tools.  
- **L6_memory.ipynb**: Learn how to give your agent the ability to maintain state between invocations.  
- **L7_structuredOutput.ipynb**: Learn how to produce structured output from your agent.  

---

### `L8-9.ipynb` - 🪛 Customize Your Agent 🤖
Lessons 2–7 covered out-of-the-box features. However, `create_agent` also supports both prebuilt and user-defined customization through **Middleware**. This section describes middleware and includes two lessons highlighting specific use cases.

- **L8_dynamic.ipynb**: Learn how to dynamically modify the agent’s system prompt to react to changing contexts.  
- **L9_HITL.ipynb**: Learn how to use Interrupts to enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions.
