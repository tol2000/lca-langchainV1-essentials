## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- The [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser is recommended
- [git](https://git-scm.com/install/) is recommended
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (includes `uvx`, required by notebook 5)
- The course requires Python >=3.11, <3.14. `uv` will take care of this for you.

### Installation

Download the course repository

```bash
# Clone the repo, cd to 'python' directory
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-langchainV1-essentials.git
cd ./lca-langchainV1-essentials/python
```

Make a copy of example.env

```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

Insert API keys directly into .env file, [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) (required) and [LangSmith](#getting-started-with-langsmith) (optional)

```bash
# Add Google API key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
# The course is written with Google GenAI models, but you can choose others if you prefer. 
# Be sure to add the key and modify the code to call your preferred model
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here_if_you_prefer

# Optional API key for LangSmith tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=langchain-py-essentials
# If you are on the EU instance:
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com

```

Make a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

Run notebooks

```bash
# Run Jupyter notebooks directly with uv
uv run jupyter lab

# Or activate the virtual environment if preferred
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
jupyter lab
```

Optional: Setup [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/studio)

```bash
# copy the .env file you created above to the studio directory
cp .env ./studio/.
cd studio
#to run with uv
uv run langgraph dev
#to run with virtual env
langgraph dev
```

### Getting Started with LangSmith

- Create a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account
- Create a LangSmith API key

# 📚 Lessons
This repository contains nine short notebooks that serve as brief introductions to many of the most-used features in LangChain, starting with the new **Create Agent**.

---

### `L1_fast_agent.ipynb` - 🤖 Create Agent 🤖
- In this notebook, you will use LangChain’s `create_agent` to build an SQL agent in just a few lines of code.  
- It demonstrates how quick and easy it is to build a powerful agent. You can easily take this agent and apply it to your own project. 
- You will also use **LangSmith Studio**, a handy visual debugger to run, host, and explore agents.

---

### `L2-7.ipynb` - 🧱 Building Blocks 🧱
In Lessons 2–7, you will learn how to use some of the fundamental building blocks in LangChain. These lessons explain and complement `create_agent`, and you’ll find them useful when creating your own agents. Each lesson is concise and focused.

- **L2_messages.ipynb**: Learn how messages convey information between agent components.  
- **L3_streaming.ipynb**: Learn how to reduce user-perceived latency using streaming.  
- **L4_tools.ipynb**: Learn basic tool use to enhance your model with custom or prebuilt tools.  
- **L5_tools_with_mcp.ipynb**: Learn to use the LangChain MCP adapter to access the world of MCP tools.  
- **L6_memory.ipynb**: Learn how to give your agent the ability to maintain state between invocations.  
- **L7_structuredOutput.ipynb**: Learn how to produce structured output from your agent.  

---

### `L8-9.ipynb` - 🪛 Customize Your Agent 🤖
Lessons 2–7 covered out-of-the-box features. However, `create_agent` also supports both prebuilt and user-defined customization through **Middleware**. This section describes middleware and includes two lessons highlighting specific use cases.

- **L8_dynamic.ipynb**: Learn how to dynamically modify the agent’s system prompt to react to changing contexts.  
- **L9_HITL.ipynb**: Learn how to use Interrupts to enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions.
